# OSMM Functional Sites and Access Points

These are **LYRX** files for OSMM Functional Sites and Access Points in **Geopackage** format for use in **ESRI ArcPro**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Sites-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  In ArcPro, right-click on ‘Map’ at the top of the Contents pane, select Properties… > then under the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid. You may need to reposition to the data extent

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference (e.g. geopackage, ESRI ArcPro stylesheets)
