# OSMM Functional Sites and Access Points

These are QML files for OSMM Functional Sites and Access Points in Geopackage format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Sites-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**3.**  Open QGIS

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Vector Layer’ button and navigate to your data

**4.**  Select the data and click ‘OK’

**5.**  Double-click on each layer in turn to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the matching QML file > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

We recommend viewing of the map between **1:1,000** and **1:10,000** for maximum legibility
